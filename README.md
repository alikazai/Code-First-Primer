This is a simple CRUD Applciation that allows the user to view, add, delete & edit Teams and Players.

This was created using the tutorial by Medhat Elmasry however as the video is difficult view the code I decided to upload this so people can people can view a working model of this application.

The tutorial video is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9GdkmFzoPw

This is a good first approach to create an ASP.NET MVC 5 application that uses the Entity Framework Code First Development approach with C#, SQL Server LocalDB and Visual Studio.
